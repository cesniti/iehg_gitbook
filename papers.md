The IEHG has agreed upon a standardized data exchange format for detailed water level information that can be used by applications to display the actual water depth or for voyage planning. A precondition is the encoding of the depth in accordance with I.1.2 of the Encoding Guide for Inland ENCs:

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/standardized\_waterlevel\_files\_v03.pdf" caption="Description of the standardized water level exchange format 2009-04-14 \(pdf, 112 kB\)" %}

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/waterlevel\_v1\_0.zip" caption="XML schema of the standardized water level exchange format 2010-10-28 \(zip with the xsd, 3 kB\)" %}

IEHG has also developed "Recommended validation checks for Inland ENCs".

### Recommended validation checks for Inland ENCs 1.1 \(based on S-58 Edition 4.2 and Edition 2.1 of Inland ENCs\) :

### Preliminary Version of the Recommended validation checks for Inland ENCs 2.4 \(based on S-58 Edition 4.2 and Edition 2.4 of Inland ENCs\). This Version will get official Status after implementation.

### The following Excel sheet is providing an overview of the minimum content of Inland ENCs. It has been the basis for version 2.3.5 of the Encoding Guide.
