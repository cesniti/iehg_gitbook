# IENC Producer and Waterway Codes



According to Edition 2.5 of the draft Inland ECDIS Standard the waterway code in the file name of the IENC should be defined by the competent Authority. 

Competent authorities might decide to use the codes in the information about the status of the producer codes and waterway codes, which is independent of the editions of the standard. Even recently assigned new codes can be used for older editions of the standard.
