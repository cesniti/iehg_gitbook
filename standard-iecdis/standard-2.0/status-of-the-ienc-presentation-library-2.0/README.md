# IENC Presentation Library 2.0

 This side refers to **Inland ECDIS Standard Edition 2.0, Section 3** It is outside of the scope of work of the Inland ENC Harmonization Group and has only been adopted for Europe and the Russian Federation. S-57 data sets do not contain any information about how it is going to be presented. The chart presentation is generated online in the Inland ECDIS application. For that purpose, the Inland ECDIS application uses machine readable symbolization instructions for each feature which is drawn on the screen. For the pres-entation of ENCs the IHO S-52 standard is mandatory. The S-52 standard contains all rules which are necessary for the symbolization and presentation of ENCs on the screen. Since the features, attributes and enumerations for ENCs were extended for Inland ENCs an extension of the S-52 standard is necessary as well in order to be able to display also the Inland specific features. All extensions apply to the Edition 3.3 of the IHO ECDIS Presentation Library \(Annex A of Appendix 2 of S-52\).
